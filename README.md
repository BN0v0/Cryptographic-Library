# Cryptographic Library 

Simple and user friendly C++ library built to embedded systems and IoT devices. This library was primarly idealized to work with resource contrained IoT devices. 

Included Cryptographic Algorithms:
- AES 
- DES 
- 3DES 
- Blowfish
- RSA 

Every Algorithm is composed by two encryption modes: ECB (Electronic CodeBook) and CBC (Cipher-block chaining), except RSA.


Some Examples of how to use the library are in the Examples folder.

Unit Tests in the Tests folder. 

Working on Arduino and WEMOS/ESP.

This library was developed in the Platform IO, therefore there is -> #include <Arduino.h>.
